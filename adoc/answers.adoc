== Can I add annotations on axioms?

* OWL allows annotation of axioms
* For example as provenance for axiom
* Tawny provides a syntax for this
* Annotates `SubClassOf` axiom between `Man` and `Person` with a comment.

[source,lisp]
----
(defclass Man
 :super
 (annotate Person
           (owl-comment "States that every man is a person")))
----

== How does this affect ontology deployment

* Potentially none -- Tawny generates an OWL file
* Potentially automatable
** Can add publication code to project source
** Can expand the *project* to publish (i.e. leiningen)
* Or can publish as a maven artefact
** Ontology can be downloaded as a software artefact
** Separates out ontology identifier and download location
** Manages all ontology dependency resolution
** And provides tools for examining dependency transitive closure

== How do you version your ontology?

* Tawny-OWL uses a line-orientated syntax
* You edit *source code* not a visualisation of an XML file
* Like various OBO flat file syntaxes, it works well in git or any VCS
* Leiningen supports release versioning, using Semantic Versioning

== How do you test your ontology

* Clojure supports one or more unit tests frameworks
* We use the default (core.test) framework
* Tawny-OWL provides some fixtures
* Also use spreadsheet generated testing
** Paper – http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04112
** Tawny-Karyotype – http://github.com/jaydchan/tawny-karyotype
** Plain English Summary - http://www.russet.org.uk/blog/3074

== How do you continuously integrate your ontology?

* We can test ontologies with standard frameworks
* These can run directly from leiningen
* This workflow allows the use of standard CI environment with no changes
* We use github/travis-CI
* Note, iff you import ontologies via URI, you may not get a repeatable build.

== What about advanced documentation for Ontologies?

* Tawny-OWL ontologies are readable text
* It is possible to embed rich readable comments
* Also can use literate programming tools
* noweb, or org-mode use traditional approach
* I have also developed "lentic" which integrates with editor

== Can I internationalise my ontology?

* Can add internationalised labels

[source,lisp]
----
(label "Ciao" "it")
----

* Can define internationalized function aliases

[source,lisp]
----
(defn etichetta [l]
  (label l "it"))
----

* Can use `tawny.polyglot` to use property bundles

== Can I scaffold my ontology from existing source

* Can "import" ontology terms from spreadsheet, XML or a database
* Can work over existing source
* Therefore can generate core of ontology
* And expand it with manually annotated crosslinks

* See paper in ICBO 2015!

== What happens if the labels of read ontologies change

* OBO ontologies use numeric IDs
* These are unreadable, so we syntactically transform labels
* If label changes (but ID remains the same) is a problem
* Can use `tawny.memorize` to remember mappings
* Then add aliases to those now missing (with optional "deprecated" warnings)

== How do you convert an existing ontology to Tawny

* `tawny.render` can perform a syntactic transformation
* Given OWL provides equivalent Clojure code
* Used interactively to provide documentation
* Can be used to port an ontology
* Currently "patternising" ontology is manual
* See Jennifer Warrenders PhD thesis where we did this with SIO

== How Fast is Tawny

* For raw, un-patternized ontology tawny takes about 2x as reading OWL/XML
* Tested by rendering and load GO
* About 56Mb of lisp
* Loads in about 1min
* Most of excess time is in parsing (Clojure also compiles)
* Patternized ontology would involve less parsing

== Can I integrate more tightly with protege?

* We have build a GUI shell into Protege
* Can also use Protege to open a Clojure REPL via a socket
* Protege then displays directly the state of Tawny
* Good for demonstration
* But a little flaky for normal use
* Having Protege reload an OWL file easier


== How does Tawny affect dependency management with ontologies?

* Clojure uses maven dependency management
* We can specify dependencies with versions
* Can fix versions or specify ranges
* Can use standard tools to display, query and analyse versions
* Can publish on Maven central or Clojars (no infrastructure to maintain!)

== Can I link ontologies into software?

* OWL API objects become first class entities in Clojure
* Can refer to them directly
* We integrated Overtone -- a music generation system
* Added in Tawny-OWL and the Music Ontology
* We now have software that plays a tune
* And provides OWL metadata about that tune
* More to investigate here.
