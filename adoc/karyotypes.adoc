== Motivation

* Tawny-OWL was initially an accidental tool
* We did not start off writing a new environment
* We discovered we needed while trying to build an ontology

ifndef::backend-slidy[]
[NOTE]
====

We didn't start out to develop a new ontology engineering tool. It
happened along the way, as we tried at address a specific use case,
which was modelling human karyotypes.

====
endif::backend-slidy[]


== Use Case (karyotypes)

* Current, string representation comes from ISCN
* Written in a book, no computational representation
* The human karyotype is complex to describe

ifndef::backend-slidy[]
[NOTE]

====
What is a karyotype? A karyotype is a description of the chromosomes of
a cell.

The current string representation comes from the International
Systematic human Cytogenetic Nomenclature.
It is a composite of three pieces of information:
1. the number of chromosome
2. the sex chromosomes present
3. the presence of any abnormalities (if any)

The current representation goes back to the days of type writers. ISCN
is published as a book. The specification is not machine
interpretable, the ISCN strings themselves are not interpretable, in
fact, you cannot even represent them fully in ASCII because they use
meaningful underlines (to describe homologous abnormalities).

In addition, we find that describing human karyotypes is complex.

== Use Case (karyotypes)

* Alterations, even more so

{set:incremental}

* 46,XX
* 47,XXY (aka Klinefelter's Syndrome)
* 46,Xc,+21
* 46,XY,+21c,-21
* 45,XY,-10,der(10)t(10;17)(q22;p12)
* 46,XY,der(7)t(2;7)(q21;q22)ins(7;?)(q22;?)
* 46,XX,der(8)t(8;17)(p23;q21)inv(8)(p22q13)t(8;22)(q22;q12)
* 46,XX,der(9)del(9)(p12)t(9;22)(q34;q11.2),der(9)t(9;12)(p13;q22)inv(9)(q13;q22)

{set:incremental!}

* An ontological representation seems like a nice idea

ifndef::backend-slidy[]
[NOTE]
====

Especially when alterations are involved.

1. The first ISCN string represents a female individual with no
   alterations

2. The second is the ISCN string for a male individual with
   Klinefelter's syndrome -- an additional x chromosome

...and so on.

What we show here is that the karyotype are progressively getting more
complex.

It is for thesse reasons (underlining and complexity) an ontological
representation seems like a nice idea.

== A partonomy?

* What you see is what you get?
* There are 24 chromosomes
* Around 1000 bands, at different resolutions

image::ChromXISCN09.jpg[height=300]

ifndef::backend-slidy[]
[NOTE]
====

How would we go about building an ontology for karyotypes?

We could build it using a strict partonomy...

There are:
- 24 chromosomes (chromosomes 1-22, X and Y)
- more than 1000 chromosome bands (bands can be subdivided into
  sub-bands depending on which resolution you karyotype as shown in
  the pic)

And generally these classes are of similar structure.

====
endif::backend-slidy[]


== Protege

* Could do this in Protege
* Technically, it scales well to an ontology of this size

image::protege-pizza.png[height=300]

ifndef::backend-slidy[]
[NOTE]
====

We could build this in Protege. Technically, 1000 terms is not a
problem for Protege, it can scale to this size (or, indeed,
considerably larger) with relative easy.

====
endif::backend-slidy[]


== Protege

* But the user interface does not
* Generating many similar classes is painful
* Hard to know how an axiomatisation will perform at the start
* Changing them afterwards even worse

image::click.gif[height=300]

ifndef::backend-slidy[]
[NOTE]
====

But the UI doesn't scale in this way. It involves an awful lot of
clicking -- one report I have heard suggests that Protege users spend
up to 50% of their time expanding and closing the hierarchy.

With the karyotype ontology this problem would be profound.

Worse, with the karyotype ontology we have a specific computational
use in mind, and we don't know what the performance is going to be
like -- reasoners can change performance quite a lot with different
axiomatisations.

If we want to change the axiomatisation after built, worst case
scenario, we start again.

====
endif::backend-slidy[]


== Protege

* We end up more like this

image::click-fast.gif[height=300]


ifndef::backend-slidy[]
[NOTE]
====

In practice, we are more likely to end up like this; 1000 classes is
an awful lot of clicking, particularly when many of the classes are
very similar.

====
endif::backend-slidy[]


== Can we do this programmatically?

* Yes, but painfully
* OWL API -- used by many, including Protege 4
* Java and the OWL API are long-winded
* Compile-Code-Test cycle

[source,java]
----
// Create ontology
OWLOntologyManager m = create();
OWLOntology o = m.createOntology(example_iri);
// Add the OWL classes
OWLClass nucleus = df.getOWLClass(IRI.create(example_iri + "#Nucleus"));
OWLClass cell = df.getOWLClass(IRI.create(example_iri + "#Cell"));
// Add the OWL object property
OWLObjectProperty partOf = df.getOWLObjectProperty(IRI.create(example_iri + "#partOf"));
// Assert the axiom
// 1. Create the class expression
OWLClassExpression partOfSomecell = df.getOWLObjectSomeValuesFrom(partOf, cell);
// 2. Now create the axiom
OWLAxiom axiom = df.getOWLSubClassOfAxiom(nucleus, partOfSomeCell);
// 2. Add the axiom to the ontology
AddAxiom addAxiom = new AddAxiom(o, axiom);
// 3. We now use the manager to apply the change
m.applyChange(addAxiom);
----

ifndef::backend-slidy[]
[NOTE]

Can we do this programmatically?

Yes we can. The main API out there is the OWL API which is used by
many, including Protege 4.

It's nice, but is long winded, and difficult. Both because of the
complexity of a type system needed for OWL (from the Javadoc it is
hard to work out which methods can be invoked on which type), the
change object system (so, you can use AddAxiom to add an annotation to
an ontology, but only if you don't care about it working), and the
factory layer. All complex.

In addition, it can be time consuming completing the compile-code-test
cycle over and over.

== Brain

* Written by Samuel Croset, EBI
* EL only
* How does this script fit with Java's OO design?
* Compile-Run cycle

[source,java]
----
// Create ontology
Brain brain = new Brain();
// Add the OWL classes
brain.addClass("Nucleus");
brain.addClass("Cell");
// Add the OWL object property
brain.addObjectProperty("partOf");
// Assert the axiom
brain.subClassOf("Nucleus", "partOf some Cell");
----

ifndef::backend-slidy[]
[NOTE]
====

There are alternatives. 

For example Brain, written by Samuel Croset. It is much lighter weight
than the OWL API.

But it is only EL expressive, and it is unclear how (what is
essentially a script) fits with Java's OO design.

Lastly any changes require, recompile, restart which is slow/time
consuming.

== The Paragon : R

* *R* provides an interactive, exploratory environment for statistics
* Command line shell, wrapped by several GUIs
* Language is convenient to type and use

{set:incremental}

* It's not all good
* The syntax can be bizarre
* The language semantics are strange

{set:incremental!}

ifndef::backend-slidy[]
[NOTE]
====

So what is the ideal? 

Something like R, the statistical language. It is interactive,
convenient to use. It can be used cleanly in batch. In general, very
nice to type and use.

However we're not saying that we wanted to copy all of its features
though. The syntax can be bizarre and the language semantics can be
considered strange.

====
endif::backend-slidy[]


== Constraints

* Simple to do (structurally) simple ontologies
* OWL API -- too much code to rewrite
* Java (JVM) -- because of the OWL API
* Pre-existing development tooling

ifndef::backend-slidy[]
[NOTE]
====

These are the limitations that we had to live within. 

Most importantly of all, I wanted it to be as simple as possible to
build structurally simple ontologies. It should largely be possible to
type and write ontologies without feeling that you are programming.

It was going to be written using the OWL API because there is too much code
there to rewrite, and no one would trust Phil to do that in a standards
compliant way.

This required the use of the JVM.

Lastly I wanted access to pre-existing development tooling. I did not
want to build a complete development environment, I needed something
off-the-shelf, so that it was good.

====
endif::backend-slidy[]


== Karyotype Ontology

* What have we achieved?
* Around 1000 classes in the karyotype ontology
* Similar numbers of tests, structural and reasoner based
* Models 10 events, with patterns for downstream use
* Multiple levels of ploidy
* Performance tested axiomatisation

ifndef::backend-slidy[]
[NOTE]
====

Before I move onto Tawny-OWL features, I want to briefly summarise
what we achieved with the karyotype ontology.

Well, I think quite a lot. We now have a large, consistent (in both
the formal and informal sense of the word) ontology that describes
most levels of the ISCN.
