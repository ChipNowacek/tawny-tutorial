== Summary
* Task 1 -- Build a hello world ontology
* Task 2 -- Build the amino acid tree
* Task 3 -- Using facets to define amino acid properties
* Task 4 -- Introduced patterns e.g. the value partition pattern
* Task 5 -- Symbols, IRIs and Tawny Names and handling OBO Identifiers
* Task 6 -- Referring to existing ontology entities
* Task 7 -- Importing existing ontologies into Tawny
* Task 8 -- Extending Tawny-OWL syntax to programmatically generate
  many defined classes

[NOTE]
====

This is the end of the planned material.

Just to summarise:
- In task 1 I showed how to build a helo world ontology; introduced
  namespace, defontology, defclass, defoproperty, frames
- In task 2 I showed how to build a simple amino acid hierarchal
  tree; defining disjoint and covering axioms
TODO

== Conclusions

* Hope the tutorial was worthwhile!
* Tawny-OWL can change the way you build ontologies
* Will actively support use
* Always interested in future collaborations
