== Summary
* Task 1 - Built a hello world ontology
* Task 2 - Built the amino acid tree (classes only)
* Task 3 - Introduced facets to define amino acid existential
  restrictions
* Task 4 - Introduced patterns e.g. the value partition pattern to
  define our properties
* Task 5 - How Tawny-OWL supports OBO Identifiers
* Task 6 - Using other existing Tawny-OWL ontologies
* Task 7 - Reading other existing ontologies into Tawny-OWL
* Task 8 - Extending Tawny-OWL syntax to programmatically generate
  many amino acid classes and defined classes
