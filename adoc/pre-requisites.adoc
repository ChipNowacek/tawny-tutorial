== Installing JVM

* You will need Java 1.7 or upward
* 1.8 or upward is recommended 

* https://java.com/en/download/
* Or use your OS package manager
* You need JDK, not just JRE

== Installing Leiningen

* This is a Clojure build tool
* http://leiningen.org/
* Download the shell script (Linux,Mac) and run it!
* Or your package manager (*leiningen 2* -- lein 1 will not work)
* For Windows, the installer works
* http://leiningen-win-installer.djpowell.net/
* Or you can download the batch file and setup manually

== Testing the Pre-Requisites

* In the terminal/cmd, in tawny-tutorial directory

`lein run`

* There will be a long download period then:

`The Tawny Tutorial is Installed and Ready`

== Protege

* Not really a pre-requisite
* One part will use it if available

http://protege.stanford.edu

== Or: the alternative

* Install some Clojure IDE/Environment
* Emacs with CIDER is my environment of choice
* Eclipse with Counter Clockwise.
* VIM Fireplace
* Any of the many other options
* If you do this, you are on your own...
* You will get a much stronger editing environment than otherwise
