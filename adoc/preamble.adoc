== Introduction

* Tawny-OWL is fully programmatic environment for Ontology Development
* Presents a different model of ontology development
* Very powerful
* Allows reuse of commodity tooling


== Today

* Some taught material
* Some "follow-by-leader"
* Plenty of time for questions
* A flexible tail

Today, we will have some taught material, particularly at the beginning and
the end, where I need to describe parts of the system, some practical time
where we build a small ontology using tawny. Then I have a reasonably flexible
tail where I try and address questions that people have. Also, there is a
degree of guesswork into how much material I can get into the time available,
which this helps to address.

I do not have time to describe all of the features of tawny, nor give a full
tutorial.

== Today

* Attempted to make decoupled

Although the tutorial does "build" I have tried to make it as loosely coupled
as possible.
